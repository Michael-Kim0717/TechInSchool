  > "The DREAM: Giants like Google and Facebook thrive of personal data. In exchange for our personal likes and things we search for, both google and facebook can offer us more personalized experience. I want to offer each student every possible way to improve his or her grades, attendance and/or behavior in exchange of ALL data" - Kunle Babatunde
